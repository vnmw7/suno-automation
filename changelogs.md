## [2025-08-02] - AI Agent Integration & Future Improvements

### Added
- AI prompt functions (`generate_verse_ranges`, `generate_song_structure`, `analyze_passage_tone`) to Google ADK Agent in `backend/multi_tool_agent/song_generation_agent.py`
- Integration of AI tools with Google ADK Agent framework
- Comprehensive AI generation logging system in `backend/utils/ai_functions.py`
  - Logs all AI requests and responses to dated log files
  - Created log viewer utility (`backend/utils/log_viewer.py`)
  - Added log directory with proper .gitignore configuration
- Test script for AI logging functionality (`backend/utils/test_ai_logging.py`)

### Changed
- Removed placeholder AI comments from `song_generation_agent.py`
- Replaced direct LLM utility calls (`llm_general_query`, `aimlapi_general_query`) with agent-based approach
- Simplified JSON extraction logic to handle agent responses
- Added TODO markers throughout codebase for future improvements:
  - Centralize AI prompts in constants file
  - Implement AI response caching
  - Add song structure validation
  - Improve logging with structured format
  - Move book abbreviations to config/database
  - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Implement rate limiting for LLM API
  - Add telemetry/metrics tracking
  - Fix Agent method calls (use correct method instead of 'run')

### Fixed
- Improved error handling in song download endpoint
- Enhanced element location strategies in browser automation
- Added duplicate song handling in download logic
- Fixed circular import issue in `backend/multi_tool_agent/__init__.py`

### Known Issues
- Google ADK Agent object uses different method name than 'run' - needs investigation
- Agent tool functions currently return prompts as strings instead of executing them
- Need to verify google-adk package installation and API key configuration
