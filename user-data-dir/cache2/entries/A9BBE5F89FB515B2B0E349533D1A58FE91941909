The vocal delivery is heartfelt, melancholic, and soaring\u2014especially in the repeated \u201cmaybe\u201d lines, which are drawn out and intensely emotional.

Meeting a True Artist \ud83c\udfad\nSome artists don\u2019t just follow trends\u2014they create their own universe. Maybe is one of them. \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf3f\n\nI discovered her one night, in my time zone \ud83c\udf19, back when comments didn\u2019t exist on Suno. At that time, she was singing emotional songs, sometimes in French, sometimes in Chinese, with a sensitivity that truly touched the soul \ud83d\udcab.\n\nBut as I followed her more closely, I was heartbroken. Maybe wasn\u2019t receiving any recognition, and her talent seemed invisible to others \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f. When comments finally became possible, I wanted to express my admiration. Yet, that night, I didn\u2019t see a shining Maybe\u2014I saw a Maybe who was crushed, deeply affected \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udca7.\n\n2. An Injustice on Suno \u2696\ufe0f\nWhy this sadness? Why was such a gifted and authentic artist receiving no recognition? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI observed, and I understood. The like system \ud83d\udc4d\u274c, this merciless mechanism that ranks, sorts, and reduces artists to numbers, was the root of her suffering. But Maybe wasn\u2019t alone\u2014an entire community of creators lived the same reality \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc65.\n\nTalented artists, Suno\u2019s \"invisible\" creators, were making music with no one taking the time to listen \ud83d\udd07. This injustice outraged me \ud83d\udd25.\n\n3. The Transformation of a Fearless Artist \ud83e\udd8b\nBut Maybe is a fighter. She could have given up, disappeared, but instead, she chose to turn her pain into creative fuel. \u26a1\ud83c\udfa8\n\nI watched Maybe take musical risks, step outside her comfort zone \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8, and explore new genres like house music \ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udd0a, which she had never tried before. She reinvented herself, regained confidence, and realized that her creativity shouldn\u2019t depend on validation \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude80.\n\nSlowly but surely, she emerged, creating captivating tracks, sometimes rhythmic \ud83e\udd41, sometimes emotional \ud83d\udc9c, sometimes even experimental \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f.\n\n4. Maybe Today: A Beam of Light \ud83c\udf1e\nToday, Maybe is no longer alone \ud83e\udd1d. She has found friends, she smiles, she creates with passion, not to please others but simply to express herself \ud83d\udc95.\n\nHer greatest strength isn\u2019t just her talent\u2014it\u2019s her positive spirit \ud83d\udca1, this energy that radiates warmth and attracts others with the same beautiful mindset \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf08.\n\n5.

won\u2019t do.\nI\u2019m tangled in chaos, \nand all I can find,\nIt's a fever of almosts I carry inside.\n(Carry inside....)\n\n[Caesura]\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou\u2019re my anchor but you\u2019re the storm,\nThe silence shatters, and it feels so warm.\nI moth-flame when you look my way,\nBut when you walk out, \nthe shadows come to play.\nMmmm....\nWords in my throat, but I choke on the sound,\nRunning in circles, no solid ground.\nThoughts like glitter, \nimpossible to shake.\nCradling shards, \nthat keep cutting me back.\n(Back.... mmmm....)\n\n[Hook]\nHold my breath, like I'm

It portrays someone trapped in a false love\u2014fully aware it's a lie, yet willingly sinking deeper into it.

testament to trust\u2019s decay,\nBut you narrate the index with such a charming, wry dismay.\nYour temper\u2019s a kaleidoscope, a sudden, fractured light,\nRefracting rage and tenderness in the span of a single night.\nThey call it instability, a pattern to deconstruct,\nI call it avant-garde, the way your moods conduct.\nA symphony of symptoms, a beautifully flawed design,\nAnd darling, your particular brand of chaos chimes with mine.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe self-help gurus preach of harbors, placid and serene,\nBut I've always found my solace in a more tempestuous scene.\nTheir well-adjusted wisdom, a lullaby so bland,\nCan\u2019t match the thrilling dissonance of the storm held in your hand.\n\n[Chorus 1]\nOh, I see the flags, all crimson and so clear!\nBut I like the color, it banishes all fear.\nIt's the shade of authenticity in a world of beige pretense,\nA beautiful disorder, making perfect, twisted sense!\nThis isn't blindness, no, it's vision, sharp and keen,\nI see the flags, and I like the vibrant sheen!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour childhood anecdotes, a Freudian delight,\nA textbook case of \"things that go bump in the psyche's night.\"\nYou trace the fault lines in your character with such meticulous art,\nA cartographer of damage, charting every broken part.\nWe analyze our dialogues with a post-mortem grace,\nFinding the toxic tendrils, the patterns we embrace.\nIs it repetition compulsion? A script we can't unlearn? \nOr just a shared aesthetic for the bridges that we burn?\nYour lack of empathy\u2019s a feature, not a bug, it\u2019s understood,\nLike a rare, endangered species, tragically misunderstood.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe therapists all shudder, friends avert their weary gaze,\nAnother chapter in our beautifully broken, Escher-staircase maze.\nMy sanity's a rumor, your love's a cherished, aching wound,\nIn this shared delirium, my truest north I have attuned.\n\n[Chorus 2]\nOh, I see the flags, they're a vibrant, burning hue!\nAnd I like the color, reflects me, reflects you!\nIt's the tint of raw existence, no filter, no disguise,\nA glorious catastrophe, mirrored in our eyes!\nThis isn't madness, darling, it's a curated, conscious spree,\nI see the flags, and they look like home to me!\n\nSo, call it trauma bonding, a Freudian pas de deux! Call it folie \u00e0 deux with a rather fetching view!\nCall it Nietzsche\u2019s amor fati \u2013 to love the tangled fate the beautiful destruction, sealing our soul\u2019s gate!\nThey prattle on of \"healthy,\" of \"stable,\" and \"secure,\"\nBut their vanilla virtues are so dreadfully demure!\nTheir \"normal\" is a narrative, a carefully constructed lie\nA muted watercolor beneath a vast and empty sky!\nGive me the grand inferno, the operatic crash,\nThe kind of love that leaves you with a fascinating psychic rash!\nA love that knows its wreckage, that wears its scars with pride,\nWhere all the warning signals are the features we don't hide!\nIt\u2019s not about the damage, it\u2019s the artistry within,\nThe exquisite, awful beauty of where the cracks begin!\nSo let them wave their little pamphlets, their five-step plans to peace,\nOur kind of love\u2019s a masterpiece that finds in flaws release!\n\n\n[Chorus 3]\nSo let them wave, these flags of mine, of yours, this vibrant, fatal sign!\nI love the color, let it bleed! It\u2019s the only truth I'll ever need.\nIn this grand opera of our beautiful, beautiful, beautiful decline!\nThis isn't sickness, it's a choice, a resonating, vibrant voice!\nI see the flags, and I rejoice, I truly, madly, deeply rejoice!\n\n[Outro]\nWell, that was fun.\nGoodbye!", "type": "edit_v3_export", "duration": 398.336, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true,

dancing as they spin around  \nBefore six thousand dreams awake anew  \nI reach out to a mirror cracked in two  \n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nScars I've woven, hidden deep inside  \nTurn into a rainbow clear and bright  \nLet me feel that glow once more tonight  \n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll the words we shared begin to fly  \nSpinning twice around the endless sky  \nCountless bonds untangle in the air  \nAs you and I breathe in this newfound flair  \nLonely shades dissolve within the gleam  \nPassing through our fingers, light redeems  \nA future painted vivid from our dreams  \n\n[Post-Chorus 1]\nTurning, turning, ah-ah  \nTurning, turning, ah-ah  \n\n[Verse 2]\nHidden fragments no one's ever seen  \nGlass reflections piercing into me  \nPromises we made without a name  \nQuietly ignite and light the flame  \n\"Kaleidoscope awaits beyond the lines\"  \nWhispers of the dragon intertwine  \n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nTracing ripples left by solitude  \nIn broken mirrors shifting into view  \nImages of you reflecting me  \nPrayers ascending to infinity  \n\"Let our bonds resound eternally\"  \n\n[Bridge]\nCircling prayers, resonating clear  \nSwirling lights of memories appear  \nScales of colors dancing in my eyes  \nShowing me a world I've yet to find  \nPromises you placed within my hands  \nStart revolving deep inside the lens  \nNow our truth illuminates again  \n\n[Chorus 2]\nSix thousand bonds ascend into the night  \nForming mandalas shimmering with light  \nEvery promise softly melts like rain  \nTranslucent drops dissolve our every pain  \nFrom the pieces scattered by your heart  \nSpinning round, my future finds its start  \nCall this world by brand-new names today  \nLet our souls rebirth along the way  \n\n[Post-Chorus 2]\nCircling, glowing, ah-ah  \nConnecting, dreaming, ah-ah  \n\n[comment]\n\"Kaleidoscope of You\" gently asks the question many of us carry deep inside:\n\"Are we truly alone?\"\nJust as a kaleidoscope reflects dazzling colors of ourselves and the world around us, \nthis song hopes to show that through connecting with each other, we can rediscover hope.\nIt symbolizes the fragmented human relationships of our social media age,\nserving as a gentle prayer that may inspire you to open your heart a little more, \nreaching out to someone beyond your screen.", "edited_clip_id": "d50e1d46-7d6c-43f1-8d0a-6d82079c81a4", "type": "edit_crop",

kid fall in a silent street,\nthree shadows moved in, like wolves on meat.\n\nI shouted, ran \u2013 didn't think at all,\nmy legs were fire, my fear went raw.\nHands were shaking, vision blurred,\nthen the world just\u2026 spun and burned.\n\nMy skin was burning, eyes turned gold,\nclaws pushed out from a heart gone cold.\nDidn\u2019t know if I\u2019d die or scream,\nbut something woke inside of me.\n\nI\u2019m no man \u2014 I\u2019m the jaguar!\nI\u2019m the bloodline roar beneath the stars!\nWhen they strike at mine, I tear apart!\nThe thunder in me\u2026 becomes my art!\n\nWe hit the ground, my fury led,\nthey ran like smoke \u2014 my growl was fed.\nNo spell, no charm, no accident,\njust an ancient soul reclaiming breath.\n\nI saw my hands, claws of night,\nfelt the sun rage in my sight.\nThe child cried, I held him tight,\nand in that moment... I knew my fight.\n\nI\u2019m no myth \u2014 I\u2019m the rebirth flame!\nJaguar spirit, no longer chained!\nI was forged in pain, not carved in fame,\nand now my silence has a name!\n\nThey thought I was weak\u2026 thought I was broken.\nBut my grandma \u2014 she always had the omen.\n\u201cIn your eyes,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s more than man\u2026\nan animal just waiting\u2026 to take a stand.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m the fire that won\u2019t go out,\nthe jaguar they forgot about.\nFrom jungle roots to urban fight,\nI am the Nahual \u2014 and I burn through the night!\n\n\u201cNow I know who I am\u2026\nIt wasn\u2019t fear\u2026\nIt was the call of the jaguar.\u201d", "type": "edit_v3_export", "duration": 172.544, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "video_upload_width": 784, "video_upload_height": 1176, "can_remix": true, "is_remix": false}, "is_liked": false, "user_id": "08abc35e-f560-42e1-9b55-7d5098fddec9", "display_name": "Mr Villain", "handle": "mr_villain", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/1b99fc09.webp", "is_trashed": false, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 31, "flag_count": 1, "created_at": "2025-06-05T15:15:34.517Z", "status": "complete", "title": "The Nahual \ud83d\udc06 #Mythical", "play_count": 973, "upvote_count": 285, "is_public": true, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5.mp4", "video_cover_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_952aed7d-f358-4b4c-b98e-f8487fde5129.mp4", "preview_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_952aed7d-f358-4b4c-b98e-f8487fde5129_preview.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5_4ed98122.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5_4ed98122.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-auk", "metadata": {"tags": "Opens with pounding Frenchcore kicks and aggressive Soviet-style rave synths, then rapid-fire rap verses ride over distorted hits and sharp metallic basses, Deathstep drops crash in, unleashing growling subs, hyper-compressed kicks, and EQ\u2019d, punchy techno bass\u2014all tightly mastered for seismic, professional impact, THX, dolby atmos", "prompt": "//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nThis is our joint work with the castle defender and worthy knight Sir CumAlot.

The instrumentation includes a four-on-the-floor drum machine pattern with a prominent kick and snare, a pulsing synth bassline providing rhythmic drive, and a sustained synth pad playing a simple A minor to G major to C major to F major chord progression. The female lead vocal is melancholic in tone, processed with a medium decay plate reverb and some subtle delay. The song structure consists of two verses, separated by instrumental breaks and a section with a distorted pad and vocalizations, followed by another verse section. The mix is centered, with the synth elements creating a hazy, lo-fi atmosphere supporting the dry lead vocal.", "prompt":
