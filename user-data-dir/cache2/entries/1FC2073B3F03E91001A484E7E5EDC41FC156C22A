Instrumentation gradually reduces, often leaving only piano or acoustic guitar with subtle pads. Characteristic guitar chords (e.g., Gbadd9/add#11 and Gbadd9, alternating with B7sus2 and Bm7 ) are prominently used here, providing a distinct bittersweet harmonic color at the very end. Harmony resolves to F Major or D Minor, giving a bittersweet sense of closure, leaving the listener with a lingering feeling of nostalgia and acceptance.

Begins with delicate piano and soft orchestral strings, progressing into emotionally charged refrains with powerful vocal swells.

The vocal delivery is heartfelt, melancholic, and soaring\u2014especially in the repeated \u201cmaybe\u201d lines, which are drawn out and intensely emotional. A tender bridge glows with poetic imagery, leading to a final chorus that crescendos with symphonic fullness and poignant vocal strength.

Just real sounds from real souls.\n______________\n\n\ud83c\udf0c MAYBE: AN EXTRAODINARY CREATOR \ud83c\udfa8\n\n1. Meeting a True Artist \ud83c\udfad\nSome artists don\u2019t just follow trends\u2014they create their own universe. Maybe is one of them. \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf3f\n\nI discovered her one night, in my time zone \ud83c\udf19, back when comments didn\u2019t exist on Suno. At that time, she was singing emotional songs, sometimes in French, sometimes in Chinese, with a sensitivity that truly touched the soul \ud83d\udcab.\n\nBut as I followed her more closely, I was heartbroken. Maybe wasn\u2019t receiving any recognition, and her talent seemed invisible to others \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f. When comments finally became possible, I wanted to express my admiration. Yet, that night, I didn\u2019t see a shining Maybe\u2014I saw a Maybe who was crushed, deeply affected \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udca7.\n\n2. An Injustice on Suno \u2696\ufe0f\nWhy this sadness? Why was such a gifted and authentic artist receiving no recognition? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI observed, and I understood. The like system \ud83d\udc4d\u274c, this merciless mechanism that ranks, sorts, and reduces artists to numbers, was the root of her suffering. But Maybe wasn\u2019t alone\u2014an entire community of creators lived the same reality \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc65.\n\nTalented artists, Suno\u2019s \"invisible\" creators, were making music with no one taking the time to listen \ud83d\udd07. This injustice outraged me \ud83d\udd25.\n\n3. The Transformation of a Fearless Artist \ud83e\udd8b\nBut Maybe is a fighter. She could have given up, disappeared, but instead, she chose to turn her pain into creative fuel. \u26a1\ud83c\udfa8\n\nI watched Maybe take musical risks, step outside her comfort zone \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8, and explore new genres like house music \ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udd0a, which she had never tried before. She reinvented herself, regained confidence, and realized that her creativity shouldn\u2019t depend on validation \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude80.\n\nSlowly but surely, she emerged, creating captivating tracks, sometimes rhythmic \ud83e\udd41, sometimes emotional \ud83d\udc9c, sometimes even experimental \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f.\n\n4. Maybe Today: A Beam of Light \ud83c\udf1e\nToday, Maybe is no longer alone \ud83e\udd1d. She has found friends, she smiles, she creates with passion, not to please others but simply to express herself \ud83d\udc95.\n\nHer greatest strength isn\u2019t just her talent\u2014it\u2019s her positive spirit \ud83d\udca1, this energy that radiates warmth and attracts others with the same beautiful mindset \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf08.\n\n5. A Promise and a Commitment \ud83e\udd1d\nBut I made a promise, one I will always keep: \"There will never be another Maybe in tears on Suno.\" \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc96\n\nThank you for reading. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfb6 \nLucilius\n______________\n[start]\n\n[Intro: Soft piano arpeggios and distant strings swell gently]\n(No lyrics \u2013 just emotional instrumental build)\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe used to cry when no one heard\nA nightingale without a word\nA garden hid behind a wall\nAfraid to bloom, afraid to fall\n\nBut I could hear her silent rain\nI touched her hand and spoke her name\nAnd with a whisper, soft and true\nI said, \"The sky was made for you\"\n\n[Pre-Refrain]\nMaybe, you don't have to cry\nIt should be me, the one who cries\nIf you're not happy, I'll never be\nMaybe\nYou don't have to cry\nMaybe\nYou don't have to hurt\nMaybe\nYou don\u2019t have to blame yourself\nFor what others do\n\n[Refrain \u2013 swelling strings and vocal power increase]\nMaybe... maybe\nThis world is not good enough to hold you\nThis world is not open enough to know you\nThis world keeps its eyes shut in the dark\nBut my heart \u2014 my heart knows how to see you\nAnd where to find you\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe learned to rise with morning light\nTo chase her shadow into flight\nShe wore her courage like a flame\nAnd sang aloud her hidden name\n\nThe winds that once had made her bow\nNow lift her wings and guide her now\nThe girl who whispered in the shade\nNow dances where the stars are made\n\n[Pre-Refrain]\nMaybe, you don't have to cry\nIt should be me, the one who cries\nIf you're not happy, I'll never be\nMaybe\nYou don't have to cry\nMaybe\nYou don't have to hurt\nMaybe\nYou don\u2019t have to blame yourself\nFor what others do\n\n[Refrain \u2013 repeated, with fuller harmony and orchestral push]\nMaybe... maybe\nThis world is not good enough to hold you\nThis world is not open enough to know you\nThis world keeps its eyes shut in the dark\nBut my heart \u2014 my heart knows how to see you\nAnd where to find you\n\n[Bridge \u2013 lumineux, po\u00e9tique \u2013 solo vocal, cinematic swell]\nShe found her voice, a silver stream\nShe turned her scars into a dream\nNo longer small, no longer shy\nShe paints her truth across the sky\n\n[Final Chorus \u2013 starts soft, builds to emotional climax]\nMaybe... maybe\nThis world is not good enough to hold you\nThis world is not open enough to know you\nThis world keeps its eyes shut in the dark\nBut my heart \u2014 my heart knows how to see you\nAnd where to find you\n\n[Outro: Soft instrumental piano fading with shimmering string chords]\n(No lyrics \u2013 emotional resolution with quiet grace)\n\n[End]", "type": "edit_v3_export", "duration": 242.85866666666666, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "video_upload_width": 864, "video_upload_height": 1280, "can_remix": false, "is_remix": false}, "is_liked": false, "user_id": "1fda17d9-6afd-4c2a-9d70-c6ef111212f0", "display_name": "\ud83d\uded1 Lucilius \ud83d\uded1\u2614\ufe0e\ufe0eMaybe\u2614\ufe0e\ufe0e \ud83d\udc8c #JuneOfLove", "handle": "lucilius", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/85889792.webp", "is_trashed": false, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 111, "flag_count": 0, "display_tags": "cinematic pop, ballad, orchestral", "created_at": "2025-06-04T15:05:03.334Z", "status": "complete", "title": "\u2614\ufe0e\ufe0eMaybe\u2614\ufe0e\ufe0e \ud83d\udc8c #JuneOfLove", "play_count": 1673, "upvote_count": 362, "is_public": true, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "78e0f504-fe91-4bfb-9128-1c4a6e111b3f", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/78e0f504-fe91-4bfb-9128-1c4a6e111b3f.mp4", "video_cover_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_7a52811e-fe21-4e12-9630-5e66e19d86be.mp4", "preview_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_7a52811e-fe21-4e12-9630-5e66e19d86be_preview.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/78e0f504-fe91-4bfb-9128-1c4a6e111b3f.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_video_upload_7a52811e-fe21-4e12-9630-5e66e19d86be_snapshot_0s.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_large_video_upload_7a52811e-fe21-4e12-9630-5e66e19d86be_snapshot_0s.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-ahi-up-1", "metadata": {"tags": "The track is an electronic lo-fi pop song in the key of A minor, with a tempo of approximately 120 BPM.

The female lead vocal is melancholic in tone, processed with a medium decay plate reverb and some subtle delay. The song structure consists of two verses, separated by instrumental breaks and a section with a distorted pad and vocalizations, followed by another verse section.

to be alone,\nHeart in hiding, turned to stone.\n\nYet beyond the shadow\u2019s reign,\nI see a light that calls my name.\nIf the world won\u2019t let me in,\nHope will never leave again.\n\nEvery tear, a shining guide,\nLighting paths so far and wide.\nI believe in dawn\u2019s embrace\u2014\nIn morning skies, I\u2019ll find my place.\n\nEvery time my tears arise,\nThey give me strength, they clear my eyes.\nI\u2019ll embrace the darkest sea\u2014\nI live in light that flows through me.\n\nBeyond the tears,\nA light appears.\n\n---\n\n\u76ee\u3092\u9589\u3058\u308c\u3070
