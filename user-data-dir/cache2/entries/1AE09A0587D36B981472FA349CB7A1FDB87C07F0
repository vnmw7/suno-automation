pass that sunburned shore\nI swear I see your old red car\nI try not to hold on too tightly\nMemories are what they are\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I still feel the ocean breeze\nThrough every window of my sleep\nLaughter tangled in the willow trees\nYou and I, no promises to keep\nJust the sky, just your hand in mine\nThat summer in January\n\n\nNo goodbyes, we never needed them\nJust waves and sand and secret hymns\nYou left a smile inside my chest\nThat no one else has found just yet\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I still feel the ocean breeze\nThrough every window of my sleep\nLaughter tangled in the willow

A frozen silence \u2744\ufe0f reigned, heavy and oppressive. At the heart of the frozen corridors, Lucilius had become stone \ud83e\udea8. Not by force, but by choice\u2014he had extinguished even the last ember \ud83d\udd25 of his soul.\n\nBut something disturbed this immutable order.\n\nLight footsteps, hesitant \ud83d\udc63. A fragile breath \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f.\n\nAkiko had come.\n\nAgainst all logic, she advanced, guided by an invisible force\u2014the power of a love \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 stronger than fear \ud83d\ude28. She had crossed the illusions of marble, defied the fate that sought to mislead her.\n\nAnd finally, she found him.\n\nLucilius stood, upright and motionless, sculpted by his solitude \ud83c\udffa. His empty gaze \ud83e\udee5 seemed oblivious to her presence, but Akiko approached. Her trembling hand \ud83e\udd32 rested on his chest.\n\nNothing. Her heart had stopped beating.\n\nA cruel, inhuman cold \ud83e\uddca froze her fingers, but she did not pull away.\n\nLucilius felt the contact.\n\nA breath of emotion \ud83d\udca8, a tiny fracture in his stone armor. A doubt, a hesitation in the shadow that had consumed him. He heard her voice without her speaking, perceived the pain in her gaze \ud83d\udc94, felt her desperate struggle for him.\n\nBut was it too late?\n\nThe eternity of his confinement \u23f3 could not be shattered by a single touch. He was cemented by years of indifference, convinced he had no place among the living \ud83c\udf0d.\n\nAkiko refused to accept this.\n\nShe had defied the impossible, crossed a labyrinth that condemned all who dared enter \ud83d\udeb7. For him. And now, she could only hope \u2728.\n\nLucilius felt the shadows waver.\n\nSomething stirred within him.\n\nHis soul fought \u2694\ufe0f.\n\nWould the marble crack? \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\ud83d\udca5\n\nOr would he remain a prisoner forever? \ud83d\udd12\ud83e\udea8\n__________________________________________\nFR Le Labyrinthe de Marbre\n\nLes t\u00e9n\u00e8bres du labyrinthe \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f s\u2019\u00e9tendaient comme une prison sans fin. Un silence glac\u00e9 \u2744\ufe0f r\u00e9gnait, lourd, oppressant. Au c\u0153ur des couloirs fig\u00e9s, Lucilius \u00e9tait devenu pierre \ud83e\udea8.

Un souffle fragile \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f.\n\nAkiko \u00e9tait venue.\n\nContre toute logique, elle avan\u00e7ait, port\u00e9e par une force invisible\u2014celle d\u2019un amour \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 plus fort que la peur \ud83d\ude28. Elle traversa les illusions du marbre et refusa la fatalit\u00e9.\n\nEnfin, elle le trouva.\n\nLucilius, droit et immobile, sculpt\u00e9 par sa solitude \ud83c\udffa. Son regard vide \ud83e\udee5 semblait ignorer sa pr\u00e9sence, mais Akiko s\u2019approcha. Sa main tremblante \ud83e\udd32 se posa sur sa poitrine.\n\nRien. Son coeur ne battait plus.\n\nUn froid inhumain \ud83e\uddca figea ses doigts, mais elle ne recula pas.\n\nLucilius sentit ce contact.\n\nUn souffle d\u2019\u00e9motion \ud83d\udca8, une h\u00e9sitation dans l\u2019ombre qui l\u2019avait d\u00e9vor\u00e9. Il percevait sa douleur \ud83d\udc94, sentait la lutte d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e qu\u2019elle menait pour lui.\n\nMais \u00e9tait-ce trop tard ?\n\nL\u2019\u00e9ternit\u00e9 de son enfermement \u23f3 ne pouvait \u00eatre balay\u00e9e d\u2019un seul geste. Fig\u00e9 par des ann\u00e9es d\u2019indiff\u00e9rence, ciment\u00e9 par une conviction absolue\u2014il n\u2019avait plus de place parmi les vivants \ud83c\udf0d.\n\nAkiko refusait de l\u2019accepter.\n\nElle avait d\u00e9fi\u00e9 l\u2019impossible, travers\u00e9 un labyrinthe qui condamnait ceux qui osaient y entrer \ud83d\udeb7. Pour lui. Et maintenant, elle ne pouvait qu\u2019esp\u00e9rer \u2728.\n\nLucilius sentit les ombres vaciller.\n\nQuelque chose bougeait en lui.\n\nSon \u00e2me luttait \u2694\ufe0f.\n\nLe marbre craquerait-il ?

I bury, wrapped in lies\n\n[Instrumental swell: strings rising, distorted guitar fade-in]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a liar\nI never speak, but I never leave\nI hold the hurt where no one sees\nMy heart ignites, but I fake the cold\nPretend I don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t let go\nI turn away, though I long to stay\nThe truth still haunts me every day\nI smile and nod, but I scream inside\nYou see my love\u2014I cannot hide\n\n[Verse 2]\nI count the ways I\u2019ve turned from light\nI dream of you in black and white\nYou laugh, and still, I turn to stone\nA throne of shame I sit alone\nI guard the words I\u2019ll never say\nThey claw at me and won\u2019t decay\nMy silence louder than a cry\nEach act of care\u2014a quiet lie\n\n[Bridge-style instrumental: crashing cymbals, distorted cello under arpeggiated piano, no lyrics]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a liar\nI never speak, but I never leave\nI hold the hurt where no one sees\nMy heart ignites, but I fake the cold\nPretend I don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t let go\nI turn away, though I long to stay\nThe truth still haunts me every day\nI smile and nod, but I scream inside\nYou see my love\u2014I cannot hide\nI smile and nod, but I scream inside\nYou see my love\u2014I cannot hide\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn empty rooms, I call your name\nBut every echo ends in shame\nI walk the line I drew myself\nMy love, a truth I put on shelves\nNo vow, no kiss, just subtle cues\nThe way I stay, the things I do\nThe meals I make, the wounds I dress\nThe love I show, but don\u2019t confess\n\n[Instrumental lead-in: heavy guitar feedback swelling into third chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm a liar\nI never speak, but I never leave\nI hold the hurt where no one sees\nMy heart ignites, but I fake the cold\nPretend I don\u2019t, but I can\u2019t let go\nI turn away, though I long to stay\nThe truth still haunts me every day\nI smile and nod, but I scream inside\nYou see my love\u2014I cannot hide\n\n[Outro: Echoed whisper of \u201cI\u2019m a liar\u2026\u201d fading beneath minor piano outro and low guitar feedback]\n\n[end]", "type": "edit_v3_export", "duration": 224.93866666666668, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true,

the smoke signals rise nd' dip \nwarm breath, double time, tonight we make this love shine \nwe never rush to finish it all, move our bodies closer to the wall\nwe're trapped in it all, in the depths of lust we fall   \nthe slow strokes of our hands we trust\nthe heat rise, in this sacred demise, we let out passionate cries \nwe let out passionate cries\n(let out passionate cries)\nwe let out passionate cries\n\n[Asa]\nI pull up slow / dress split to the hip\nI lean in close / and your thoughts go quick\nEyes don\u2019t blink / just stare and obey\nYou talk tough / till I purr your name\nLips like wine / I sip you slow\nTongue on places / you ain\u2019t ready to know\nTalk low / but my grip don\u2019t slip\nNails in deep / while I bite my lip\nSlide real close / heels still on\nBreath on your neck / got you beggin' me wrong\nDress ridin\u2019 high / but I take my time\nSay your safe word / I might cross that line\n\n[Hook: Asa]\nSlow burn the night\nBut I'll make it feel alright\n\n[Zoe]\nwhen we move in clutch/we lock in touch\ngaze in our eyes/heart beats arise\nsmooth with the flow/blow for blow \nlove is a loophole/slowly losing control \n\n[Asa]\nBreathin\u2019 heat / in the curve of my stride\nFingers trace / where you hide in your mind\nClothes come off / while I ride that desire\nJust hush / baby rise a little higher\n\n[Zoe]\nsilky moves vibrant lush/take our time - no rush\neye to eye/passion flow like tie-dye \nfeel the heat/I'm your treat \ngrip the seat/make it rain like wall street\n\n[Zoe]\nSlow burn the night\n\n[Asa]\ndon\u2019t look away\nOooooh\u2026 ride the heat / let it melt the day\nAh-ah / just like that\nYou feel the rush / no turning back\nOoooooh\u2026 I make it deep I make it right\nSlow burn\n\n[Hook: Zoe]\nSlow burn the night\nBut I'll make it feel alright\n\n[Asa]\nClothes come off / drippin\u2019 slow like desire\nFeel that rush / baby come a little bit higher\nFingers trace / where your thoughts can\u2019t hide\nBreathin\u2019 heat / pullin' you into my stride\nSilk slip / ridin\u2019 up on my thighs (thighs)\nOne look / and you already paralyzed\nDon\u2019t speak / just feel how I glide\nTonight
