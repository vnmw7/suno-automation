Female lead expands into octave-doubled folk choir in the soaring chorus. Ethnic gusli/kantele pluck riff and 16th-note dry trance pluck (touch of 303 resonance) drive the hook and drop. Techno hi-hat loops pulse with off-beat open hats.

trace it with my hand  \nYour missing echo lingers where I stand  \nMud from every stumble stains my sleeve  \nYet a tiny vow still hides where no one sees  \n\n[Pre\u2011Chorus 1]  \nMmm\u2026  \nOn a sunset hill I freeze my pace  \nGazing at a loosened lace  \n\u201cLook\u2014 I can do this all alone!\u201d  \nThat quiet line keeps pulsing in my bones  \n\n[Chorus 1]  \nI\u2019m calling through the silence, past the edge of night  \nPainting every trembling cloud with dreams we left in flight  \nI open up my pocket, feel the newborn breeze appear  \nAnd\u202fwoo\u2011woo\u2011woo, the future draws me near  \nCharting out a secret road that only I can steer  \n\n[Verse 2]  \nCrossing bells of summer ring the avenue  \nShop\u2011front glass reflects a tilted view  \nWith the crayon that I hid so long ago  \nI color in the blanks of tomorrow\u2019s glow  \n\n[Pre\u2011Chorus 2]  \nAh\u2026  \nCrowded streets, a burst of laughing sound  \nLines I sketched begin to bend around  \n\u201cHey, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t try to do!\u201d  \nMy restless pocket whispers, pulling through  \n\n[Bridge]  \nA speck of light beyond the pocket\u2019s seam  \nShakes the future I forgot to dream  \nQuietly now, my heartbeat steps ahead  \nThis journey\u2019s still unfolding, footprints spread  \n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Post\u2011Chorus\u2011Hook]  \nAh\u2026 hands that start to sway  \nAh\u2026 sighs that drift away  \nAh\u2026 dawn against the pane  \nAh\u2026 one small wish remains  \n\n[Chorus 2]  \nI\u2019m calling through the silence, past the edge of night  \nPainting every trembling cloud with dreams we left in flight  \nI open up my pocket, feel the newborn breeze appear  \nAnd\u202fwoo\u2011woo\u2011woo, the future\u2019s shining clear  \nWatch me now\u2014 I\u2019m walking on, alone but without fear  \n\n[Outro]\n\n[Comment]\n\u201cBeyond the Pocket\u201d is an anthem for those struggling to find their place in today\u2019s highly competitive society.\nThe song delicately expresses a philosophical message: that we each have the power to choose our own future, even as we face the small setbacks of everyday life.\nI aimed to create a soothing ballad that captures the gentle voice of encouragement from within, conveying that even in loneliness, there is compassion and hope.\nI hope this song helps listeners embrace themselves and find the courage to move forward.\n\n\n\n--EVENTS

lyrics are below''\n\n[Verse 1:]\nZwischen uns steht Schweigen wie ein dichter Nebel  \nHerzen spielen still die Geige unspielbare Melodie  \nBlicke sagen mehr als Worte in dieser stummen Stille  \nZarte Liebe unerkannt wie ein heimlicher Zauber  \n\n\n[Verse 2: ]\nIm Schatten unserer Seelen w\u00e4chst die stille Qual  \nGefangene Gedanken tanzen ohne Mut zu sprechen  \nAugen fl\u00fcstern Sehnsucht, doch Lippen bleiben zu  \nEin stummer Dialog zerrt an uns Tag f\u00fcr Tag  \n\n[Chorus:]\nUnausgesprochene Worte wiegt schwer auf unser Herz  \nLiebe bleibt verborgen wie ein Schatz in dunklen Tiefen  \nSei mein stiller Kuss die Sprache unserer Seelen  \nZwischen den Zeilen leben wir unser verborgenes Gl\u00fcck  \n\n\n[Verse 3:]\nDas Bl\u00f6de an unausgesprochenen Worten ist,  \nDass du sie niemals wieder h\u00f6rst, egal wie oft du wartest.  \nIch seh dich an und du siehst mich an,  \nDoch keiner von uns spricht, wir sagen einfach nichts.  \n\n[Chorus:]\nUnausgesprochene Worte wiegt schwer auf unser Herz  \nLiebe bleibt verborgen wie ein Schatz in dunklen Tiefen  \nSei mein stiller Kuss die Sprache unserer Seelen  \nZwischen den Zeilen leben wir unser verborgenes Gl\u00fcck  \n\n[Bridge:]  \nJedes stumme Seufzen schreit nach einem Wort  \nUnausgesprochene Wahrheit zerschneidet wie ein Schwert  \nWirst du je verstehen was mein Herz nicht sagen kann  \nIn dieser stillen Einsamkeit bleiben wir allein  \n\n[Chorus:] \nUnausgesprochene Worte wiegt schwer auf unser Herz  \nLiebe bleibt verborgen wie ein Schatz in dunklen Tiefen  \nSei mein stiller Kuss die Sprache unserer Seelen  \nZwischen den Zeilen leben wir unser verborgenes Gl\u00fcck  \n\n[Outro: ] \n\n(Ich kann es nicht sagen... aber du wei\u00dft es doch.)\n\n(Ich schweige... und du verstehst.)\n\n(Ich liebe dich...  ganz leise.) \n\n[English:]\n\n[Verse 1:]\nSilence stands between us like a heavy fog\nHearts quietly play the violin\u2019s unplayable melody\nGlances speak more than words in this voiceless silence\nTender love unnoticed like a hidden spell\n\n[Verse 2:]\nIn the shadows of our souls grows silent torment\nImprisoned thoughts dance, too afraid to speak\nEyes whisper longing, yet lips remain sealed\nA silent dialogue pulls at us day after day\n\n[Chorus:]\nUnspoken words weigh heavy on our hearts\nLove remains hidden like a treasure in dark depths\nLet my silent kiss be the language of our souls\nBetween the lines we live our hidden joy\n\n[Verse 3:]\nThe trouble with unspoken words is,\nYou\u2019ll never hear them, no matter how long you wait.\nI look at you, and you look at me,\nBut neither of us speaks... we just say nothing.\n\n\n[Chorus:]\nUnspoken words weigh heavy on our hearts\nLove remains hidden like a treasure in dark depths\nLet my silent kiss be the language of our souls\nBetween the lines we live our hidden joy\n\n[Bridge:]\nEvery silent sigh screams for a word\nUnspoken truth cuts like a sword\nWill you ever understand what my heart can\u2019t say?\nIn this quiet loneliness, we remain alone\n\n[Chorus:]\nUnspoken words weigh heavy on our hearts\nLove remains hidden like a treasure in dark depths\nLet my silent kiss be the language of our souls\nBetween the lines we live our hidden joy\n\n[Outro:]\n(I can't say it... but you know it.)\n\n(I stay silent... and you understand.)\n\n(I love you... so quietly.) \n\n",

orchestra.  This song is performed by a youthful soloist with a pure, clear voice, conveying hope and sincere emotion. Begin gently and thoughtfully in the first verse, letting the soft orchestral introduction create a nostalgic mood. As the first chorus arrives, build the volume and intensity, inviting the choir to join in strong, clear harmonies that convey a sense of collective unity. The second verse should maintain this hopeful warmth, with a touch more confidence. In the bridge, slow the tempo slightly, singing tenderly and reflectively to highlight the nostalgia and personal growth in the lyrics. Transition smoothly into the third verse with renewed determination and brightness, leading to the final chorus with an uplifting modulation that showcases power and grandeur. Throughout, the transitions between sections should flow naturally, with the orchestra and choir supporting dynamic changes.

me,\nIt\u2019s believed in my dreams, so faithfully\u2026\n\nA new life brings us new songs to sing,\nThe voices of youth in the springtime ring.\nHorizons will brighten, the future will gleam,\nIf today we stand strong as one in this dream!\n\nVoice of a brand-new day \u2013 I hear you, I hear you!\nGuiding me forward, in skies so clear blue.\nVoice of a brand-new day \u2013 let it shine from afar,\nWith an open heart, I\u2019ll follow that star.\n\nVoice of a brand-new day \u2013 it\u2019s me, it\u2019s you,\nOur souls and dreams forever true.\nVoice of a brand-new day \u2013 like a new

Male lead vocals, warm and expressive, ranging from soft whispers to full-throated emotional peaks. Voice should show fragility, natural vibrato, occasional rasp and falsetto. Dynamic shifts in intensity. [Verses] are stripped with clean guitars and ambient textures; [choruses] grow wide with layered guitars, deep bass, drums, and synth pads. Use subtle odd time signatures and key modulations.

Shadows stretch long in the golden evening light as footsteps echo faintly against the polished stone. Lucilius stands at the window, watching his German friends leave. He welcomed them into his home, shared laughter and music, yet never voiced the thoughts that lay heavy in his heart.\n\nFor months, he searched for a way to express what remained trapped within him. This song, \"Die Worte\"\u2014\"The Words\"\u2014is his attempt. A song not just for them, but for all. A hymn to friendship, to the ties that unite people beyond language, beyond borders.\n\nLucilius is made of marble \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f. He does not speak of emotions easily. They remain within, unexpressed, until the moment to say them is gone. Now, as his friends depart, regret sets in. If only he had spoken, if only he had told them what he felt. The words never came\u2014but through music, they finally will.\n\nThis song is inspired by Tunzuu, VLEKZ, and Slade Foley, artists who craft rap with passion. Their energy, their expression helped shape this piece. It is an echo of a shared Franco-German friendship, a bond woven by history, by proximity, by mutual understanding.\n\nThough sung in German, \"Die Worte\" speaks to everyone. It is a call to cherish the people around us, to say what should be said before it is too late. If you are among my German friends, and I have forgotten you, tell me. \"Hey, Lucilius, did you forget me or what?\" \ud83d\ude09\n\nBut beyond names, beyond lists, this is a song for all who have ever held back their feelings, only to watch time steal the chance to share them.\n\n@bsedufuel, @tunzuu, @vlekz, @sladefoley, @cyrusred, @moonrider, @thewindow, @therealfaszinosum, @dentodhinaus, @squaddi, @hisiatigy, @paradinosquirl, @zorro17, @ozzbeat_records, @scorpio959, @50739cologne, @vdk_berlin, @vocalkidfolk314, @suziii, @thousandtomorrows, @rarerecordlabel4030, @preoccupied, @dr_suno, @xxsp1derxx, @dizpater, @mp_3king, @ltahiran, @harlechryzz, @eqvirther, @vynicious, @lastxresort, @merlynn, @littlemerlin, @philality, @pantherasounds, @jusime, @foobar2, @aixpertbrain, @persistentharmonics068, @lijanna, @bmeier, @tonyindian, @julian1932\u2026 & many others!\n_________________________________________\nDie Worte \u2013 Was Ihr wissen solltet, bevor Ihr sie h\u00f6rt \ud83c\udfb6\u2728\nDeutsche Version \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea\n\nDie Marmors\u00e4le sind still. Schatten werden l\u00e4nger im goldenen Abendlicht, w\u00e4hrend Schritte leise gegen den polierten Stein hallen. Lucilius steht am Fenster und beobachtet, wie seine deutschen Freunde gehen. Er hat sie in seinem Haus willkommen gehei\u00dfen, mit ihnen gelacht, Musik geteilt \u2013 doch nie gesagt, was schwer in seinem Herzen lag.\n\nMonatelang suchte er nach einem Weg, das zu sagen, was unausgesprochen blieb. Dieses Lied, \u201eDie Worte\u201c \u2013 \u201eDie W\u00f6rter\u201c \u2013 ist sein Versuch. Ein Lied nicht nur f\u00fcr sie, sondern f\u00fcr alle. Ein Hymnus an Freundschaft, an die Verbindungen, die Menschen jenseits von Sprache und Grenzen vereinen.\n\nLucilius ist aus Marmor gemacht \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f. Gef\u00fchle auszusprechen f\u00e4llt ihm nicht leicht. Sie bleiben tief in ihm verborgen, bis der richtige Moment verstreicht. Jetzt, da seine Freunde gehen, sp\u00fcrt er die Reue. Wenn er es doch nur gesagt h\u00e4tte, wenn die Worte nicht in der Stille geblieben w\u00e4ren... Doch durch die Musik werden sie nun endlich erklingen.\n\nDieses Lied ist inspiriert von Tunzuu, VLEKZ und Slade Foley, K\u00fcnstlern, die mit Leidenschaft Rap erschaffen. Ihre Energie, ihre Ausdruckskraft haben dieses St\u00fcck gepr\u00e4gt. Es ist ein Echo einer gemeinsamen franz\u00f6sisch-deutschen Freundschaft, einem Band, gewoben durch Geschichte, N\u00e4he und gegenseitiges Verst\u00e4ndnis.\n\n\n_________________________________________\n\ud83c\udfa7 #JuneOfLove \n\ud83d\udd8d\ufe0f A playlist for every version of love \u2014 even the ones you never dared to say out loud.\nhttps://suno.com/playlist/0df36954-b3c6-40da-8de7-a131b1cfb368\n\u2764\ufe0f The idea?\nMake a track about love.\nNot postcard love.\nThe kind that shakes you.

You ask where the future leads, I just smile and say, \"I still don\u2019t know.\"\nTime moves, but we barely feel it. The wind from that day still whispers on. You're standing at the same old crossroads, And I'm still unsure\u2014do I leave, or do I stay?\nYouth is the wind from that day, Sweeping through our hearts without a sound. We dream of flying, yet remain tied to this place. That wind from before\u2014do you still remember?\n Headlights flicker as we cross the streets, Words from that day fade into mist. We hesitate to answer, we hesitate to speak, So we keep walking\u2014until morning arrives.\nThe wind rushes through the alleyway, But our shadows don\u2019t flinch or fade. If one day we reach the end, Will there be a road that leads to light?\nYouth is the wind from that day, Sweeping through our hearts without a sound. We dream of flying, yet remain tied to this place. That wind from before\u2014do you still remember?\nThe wind drifts by, and we stay silent. You're still standing at the same old crossroads, And I'm still unsure\u2014do I leave, or do I stay?\n  \n", "type": "gen", "duration": 195.0, "refund_credits": false, "stream": true, "video_upload_width": 800, "video_upload_height": 1120, "can_remix": false, "is_remix": false, "priority": 0}, "caption": "\"The Wind That Day\" ignites with raw punk energy\u2014fast, relentless drumming, distorted power chords, and a soaring anthem chorus that demands to be heard.

On top of that, there\u2019s an ongoing war in my region, forcing us to hide in bomb shelters at times.\n\nDespite everything, I continue to work hard at my job and raise my 4-year-old son without any support from either my own or my ex-wife\u2019s family. I\u2019m constantly trying to create a stable life for both of us, though I often struggle to find the right balance.\n\nThrough this song, I want to open up and share a piece of my personal story with the judges of SSC7.
