English Lyrics \u266a\u266a\u266a]\n[In This Flawed World \u00a92024 AriteAL]\n\nI see my reflection in the blurred city lights\nWondering again, where did I go wrong?\nThe weight I carry feels heavier than ever\nAnd day by day, my sighs keep getting long\n\nThat melody I pretended to forget stirs inside my chest\nAnother sleepless night\u2014so I spark a tiny flame of hope\n\nIn this flawed world, we can still find our voice\nKeep tomorrow ringing out with these imperfect tunes\nDreams I abandoned, promises that felt like lies\nI can\u2019t let them go, so here I stand\u2014still singing\n\nLa la la, la la la\nWaiting for the break of day\n\nSomewhere far away, someone\u2019s basking in the spotlight\nThe glare pierces my heart, but I can\u2019t look away\nI\u2019m done pretending I can\u2019t catch up\u2014done running from it all\nFacing my awkward self day after day\n\nFeelings I can\u2019t discard start to roar inside my mind\nI\u2019m just not cut out to be someone who easily resigns\n\nThe wish I screamed with a raspy voice\nStill lingers softly in the silent cracks of night\nBringing along the me who couldn\u2019t take that step back then\nI\u2019m walking on toward a future with no certain answers now\n\nIn this flawed world, it\u2019s okay to struggle on\nOnly these unfinished souls can find that special sound\nEven if we\u2019re scarred, it proves we\u2019re still alive\nIf every tear we\u2019ve shed can make our hearts grow strong\nThen let\u2019s keep on singing this never-ending song\n\nLa la la, la la la\nUntil the night fades away\nLa la la, la la la\nLet\u2019s raise our voices as one\n\n[Comment]\nembraces the idea of accepting ourselves and the imperfections around us,\nhighlighting the courage to keep moving forward\nalongside those who support us.\nEveryone faces moments of doubt, loneliness,\nand struggles hidden within everyday life,\nbut rather than hiding these vulnerabilities,\nthis song encourages us to confront and embrace them.\nIf you\u2019re stumbling, uncertain, or feeling incomplete,\nI hope this song gently inspires you to take another step forward.", "edited_clip_id":

because there was a distance between us,\nthat\u2019s why I could treasure you even more\nEven from far away,\nI was always thinking of you\n\nThis feeling is real\nEven without exchanging

from an old radio,\nbut somehow it felt nostalgic\nMaybe I was looking\nfor traces of you somewhere\u2014\nblended into someone\u2019s song\n\nI gently overlapped your image\nwith that tune\nEven if I couldn\u2019t meet you,\neven if I couldn\u2019t get close,\nat least thinking of you\nwas something I could do freely.\n\nI knew this love would never reach you\nBut maybe that\u2019s what made it so pure\nThat smile I saw through the screen\u2014\nI can\u2019t count how many times it saved me\nEven if I didn\u2019t put it into words,\nmy heart\u2026\nwas always right there beside
