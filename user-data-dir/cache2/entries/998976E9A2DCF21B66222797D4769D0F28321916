Just pulsing bass and sparse chords. Voice becomes more whispered, like a confession. Robotic delay echoes phrases behind. Feel: philosophical, intimate, cinematic.]\n\nThey say the universe expands\u2026 mmm\nBut why does it collapse when you\u2019re gone?\nIsn\u2019t that love?\nNot gravity, but the force that keeps us\nFrom drifting too far from what matters \u2014 yes\u2026 oh yes\u2026\n\n(Final Chorus)\n[Final Chorus \u2013 Slight modulation in chords. Add airy synth pad to elevate. More harmonies. Let this feel like an awakening, not a climax. Still dancing, but with purpose.]\n\nSo breathe me in \u2014 ha \u2014 be my dawn (dawn)\nIn this night \u2014 ah \u2014 where I don't belong (belong)\nNot just rhythm \u2014 no \u2014 you\u2019re the song (song)\nThe place I\u2019ve searched for all along (long)\n\nBreathe me in \u2014 yes \u2014 let\u2019s burn, not fade (fade)\nTwo souls that chose \u2014 oh \u2014 not to evade (evade)\nIn chaos \u2014 haha \u2014 love can still invade (invade)\nI breathe you in \u2014 and I\u2019m not afraid \u2014 oh no, not afraid", "type": "gen", "duration": 232.64, "refund_credits": false, "stream": true, "can_remix": true, "is_remix": false, "priority": 10}, "caption": "you didn\u2019t save me \u2014 you made me care", "is_liked": false, "user_id": "5f0a911a-8224-4637-a04e-d8efa15dfa2e", "display_name": "ari", "handle": "omniamore", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/e372ed14.webp", "is_trashed": false, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 152, "flag_count": 19, "display_tags": "electronic, alternative dance, rock", "is_contest_clip": false, "created_at": "2025-05-24T03:11:36.946Z", "status": "complete", "title": "Breathe Me In", "play_count": 70003, "upvote_count": 2333, "is_public": true, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "f1018ab1-8976-437b-940c-8fb10139ca9a", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f1018ab1-8976-437b-940c-8fb10139ca9a.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f1018ab1-8976-437b-940c-8fb10139ca9a.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_f1018ab1-8976-437b-940c-8fb10139ca9a.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/image_large_f1018ab1-8976-437b-940c-8fb10139ca9a.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-ahi-up-2", "metadata": {"tags": "melodic, dark, intimate, cinematic atmosphere, ambient, Tension, melancholy, cold beauty", "prompt": "[Verse]\nYou walk beneath the light\nI fade into the night\nWe turned from fate\u2019s design\nStill wrote a crime in time\n\nStreet lamps can\u2019t catch your eyes\nBut they reflect my lies\nYou smiled so clean, so bright\nI held your echoes tight\n\n[Chorus]\nUnder the white night sky\nWe never say goodbye\nLove wrapped in quiet pain\nEven our tears ran dry\n\nYou are the light I\u2019ll never touch\nI am the wound you hide too much\nWe stare across the line\nBut never dare to cross in time\n\n[Verse]\nWho paints your perfect days?\nWho burns the past away?\nYou wear your mask so well\nI chose to rot in hell\n\nThough the world is clear and blue\nWe have no place to bloom\nYou live your fiction sweet\nWhile I walk on burned streets\n\n[Chorus]\nUnder the white night sky\nWe never say goodbye\nLove wrapped in quiet pain\nEven our tears ran dry\n\nYou are the light I\u2019ll never touch\nI am the wound you hide too much\nWe stare across the line\nBut never dare to cross in time\n\n[Bridge]\nThis isn\u2019t love, it\u2019s debt we owe\nWhite nights too bright for truth to show\nNo need for hope or grace\nJust don\u2019t let sorrow leave its trace\n\n[Chorus]\nUnder the white night sky\nI\u2019ll turn to ash and fly\nSo you can walk unscarred\nI\u2019ll never ask you why\n\nEven if I\u2019m lost, alone\nI won\u2019t let you be overthrown\nIt\u2019s all I have to give -\nThis final lie I choose to live\n\n[Outro]\nLight and shadow, never one\nYou\u2019ll never know what I\u2019ve become\n", "edited_clip_id": "47916a2c-54de-4ef7-a94c-3993790de6a9", "type": "upsample", "duration": 216.2, "refund_credits": false, "stream": false, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "upsample_clip_id": "47916a2c-54de-4ef7-a94c-3993790de6a9", "task": "upsample", "can_remix": true, "is_remix": false, "priority": 10}, "caption": "Lyrics from @iami6233 ", "is_liked": false, "user_id": "16f1a405-7b9e-485a-9465-21fd0d25ec19", "display_name": "UUID", "handle": "uuid", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/mgm_cat_crop.webp", "is_trashed": false, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 72, "flag_count": 8, "display_tags": "ambient, cinematic, downtempo", "is_contest_clip": false, "created_at": "2025-06-12T22:55:23.577Z", "status": "complete", "title": "Final Lie", "play_count": 41459, "upvote_count": 1052, "is_public": true, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "7aa56e05-3e52-4cd8-b7e4-cb009480b0e7", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/7aa56e05-3e52-4cd8-b7e4-cb009480b0e7.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/7aa56e05-3e52-4cd8-b7e4-cb009480b0e7.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/7aa56e05-3e52-4cd8-b7e4-cb009480b0e7_82372449.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/7aa56e05-3e52-4cd8-b7e4-cb009480b0e7_82372449.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-auk", "metadata": {"tags": "sound collage, happy indie folktronica track with staccato percussion, distorted basslines, and experimental vocal layering.
