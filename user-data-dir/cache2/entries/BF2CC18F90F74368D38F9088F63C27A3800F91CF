loud.\nI am sitting by the window in this empty cafe,\nAnd spring reigns in my heart again.\n\n[Pre-Chorus] [Growing]\nEvery look, every gesture, every day we live\nLeaves its mark, turns into a shadow.\nI am trying to understand where reality is, where dreams are,\nYou and I are alone in the silence.\n\n[Chorus] [Melodic] [Powerful]\nMaybe it's just a movie,\nThat we are watching together.\nMaybe it's just a game,\nThat will end tomorrow morning.\nMaybe we don't need to decide,\nBut let our hearts say everything.\nMaybe...\n\n[Verse 2] [Rhythmic]\nRemember that conversation, before the stars, before the dawn?\nYou said: \"Don't look at what's waiting ahead.\"\nBut I'm looking for an answer in your phrases again,\nEither \"yes\" or \"no\" or just \"hello.\"\n\n[Pre-Chorus] [Growing]\nEvery step, every breath, every captured moment\nSuddenly turns into a deafening scream.\nI'm trying to understand where reality is, where dreams are,\nYou and I alone in the silence.\n\n[Chorus] [Melodic] [Powerful]\nMaybe it's just a movie,\nThat we're watching together.\nMaybe it's just a game,\nThat will end tomorrow morning.\nMaybe we don't need to decide,\nBut let

because some people began linking it directly to my personal story. It might affect someone who means quite a lot to me, someone rather special. So I thought it would be better if you could understand how I feel about her directly through this new piece instead.\n\nTo be honest, this was never meant to be shared publicly. But since many people might have already figured it out, I thought perhaps it\u2019s time to say a little something. \n\nThe truth is, I was planning to leave Suno. I had already told her that. But later, I changed my mind\u2014for a reason that made it necessary for me to stay. She even said she figured I\u2019d find an excuse to stay a little longer. Still, I believe that reason was meaningful enough to keep me here, at least for a while. That\u2019s why you\u2019re still seeing me around now.\n\nMy feelings for her haven\u2019t changed. No matter what happens, she will always be someone important to me. She\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve discovered here. That feeling won\u2019t change, whether I stay or go. That is something I can say with certainty. \n\nI felt I needed to explain this because it would be difficult to continue creating music while staying here, especially if people keep drawing connections. Eventually, it would reach a point where I wouldn\u2019t be able to release anything at all. That\u2019s what I wanted to express, and I truly hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to say.", "concat_history": [{"id": "2e40aaa3-519d-4077-a326-7ada7b147483", "type": "concat", "infill": false, "source": "web", "continue_at": 343.0}, {"id": "3cfb763f-23b8-43e4-be42-5da67be52a9e"}], "type": "concat", "duration": 345.4799791666667, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "video_upload_width": 608, "video_upload_height": 1080, "can_remix": false, "is_remix": true}, "caption": "\u30c4\u30c4\u30b8\u306f\u6625\u306b\u54b2\u304f\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u82b1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "is_liked": false, "user_id": "0f086853-f8c4-413e-9684-afafd8a27e07", "display_name": "1Lovely", "handle": "1lovely", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/373efde0.webp", "is_trashed": false, "is_public": true, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 0, "flag_count": 0, "display_tags": "funk rock, jazz fusion, soft rock ballad", "is_contest_clip": false, "created_at": "2025-06-27T07:42:03.143Z", "status": "complete", "title": "I Remember You", "play_count": 792, "upvote_count": 207, "allow_comments": false}, {"id": "52c51c88-ff98-47bb-bf98-20b73881c8e2", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/52c51c88-ff98-47bb-bf98-20b73881c8e2.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/52c51c88-ff98-47bb-bf98-20b73881c8e2.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/52c51c88-ff98-47bb-bf98-20b73881c8e2_fb7b6768.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/52c51c88-ff98-47bb-bf98-20b73881c8e2_fb7b6768.jpeg", "major_model_version": "", "model_name": "", "metadata": {"tags": "Dubstep, Tearout Dubstep, Cinematic Dubstep, Industrial Bass, Dark, Aggressive, Tense, Sinister, Epic, Ominous, Heavy, Cinematic, Horror, Apocalyptic, Cyberpunk, 145 BPM", "prompt": "\u256d\u2500[Blood In The Water]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u256e\n\n   \u00a9 2025 Exidious \u2014 Melody/Lyrics\n\nJust a fun track I put together for SSC Group C# (Sea Sharks)\nCheck the playlist here for more!\nhttps://suno.com/playlist/4fd16e98-2205-4e94-b761-0882994fb5ba\n\n   \n   SOCIALS\n   Exidious \n          \u00b7 x.com/ExidiousMusic  \n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/Spotify\n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/Soundcloud\n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/Deezer\n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/AppleMusic\n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/Tiktok\n          \u00b7 exidious.pro/Youtube\n\nLyrics\n  They never saw us coming\n  The water starts drumming\n  We move as one\n  Tonight's just begun\n\n  blood in the water\n\n  Tonight we feast!

Not the other way around. \ud83c\udf20\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Observing Greatness in Silence\nI started noticing it way back in November 2024.\nThere was this small account making music, not for self-promotion, but for others. \ud83c\udf31\nI watched him create heartfelt songs for @roseofpassion, @thejester, @IDALTA, @nenolo\u2026 and I thought:\n\n\u201cWait, I\u2019ve never seen this on Suno before. Ever.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I reached out and slowly became part of this little creative circle, a circle that, to this day, I call true friends. \ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udf08\n\n\ud83d\udd01 Becoming a Little More Like Matcha...\nBack then, I was just making playlists for creators I admired, artists the algorithm or playlists had overlooked. \ud83d\udcc0\u2728\nEventually, I began creating tribute songs... and suddenly I realized:\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m becoming a bit like Matcha.\u201d\n\nI had \u2014 and still have \u2014 this need to thank the people who support me, and those who have woven threads of Lucilius\u2019s universe into their own musical creations. \ud83c\udf0c\nLucilius is my alter ego, living his own adventures on Suno... surrounded by companions like Matcha.\n\n\ud83e\udea9 About That First Tribute... And My Regret\nMy first attempt to honor Matcha was with a song called \"Marble\", a remix of one of his pieces.\nBut... I made a mistake. A real one. \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude1e\n\nOut of all his beautiful tracks, I chose the one where he had already remixed one of my own old songs. His remix was so good, I didn\u2019t even recognize it at first! \ud83d\ude33\ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f\nSo in the end, I unintentionally remixed a remix of my own track, and that didn\u2019t truly honor his originality.\nI still regret that choice. It wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\ud83d\udcbf So This Time, I Created Something New \u2014 Just for Him\nI went back to a style I love, deep house, but gave it a soft, gentle texture, to reflect the kindness and subtle elegance of Matcha\u2019s spirit. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc97\n\nThis track grows gradually. The bass builds over time, like waves catching strength, just like the quiet power that Matcha brings to this platform. \ud83c\udf0c\ud83d\udd0a\nI wanted this song to feel like him. To say, through every sound and layer:\n\n\u201cThis sounds like Matcha, the person.\u201d\n\n\u23f3 Waiting for the Right Moment\nI didn\u2019t know when to release it. I was waiting for the right time.\nI had shared my fears with him, that maybe he\u2019d leave Suno, disappear quietly. But he reassured me. He stayed. \ud83d\udcac\ud83e\udec2\n\nAnd when he created the #FREE_LUCILIUS playlist, he showed me how much he cared, with actions, not just words. \ud83e\udde1\nThat\u2019s when I knew. Now is the moment.\n\nHe also created a song specifically for this playlist, and I am very grateful to him for it. But it is really his 'Don't cry for me' that inspired me.\n\n\ud83c\udf81 This Song Is My Thank You, Matcha\nSo here it is. A song born of gratitude, admiration, and love.\nFor a friend. For a creator. For someone who inspires without needing to say a word. \ud83d\udc90\ud83c\udfb6\n\nThank you, my little Matcha. \nThis is for you. \ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc9a\nI hope you find this song as beautiful as the last one you made for me, which is really very high quality.\n\nWith all my heart,\nLucilius \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb5\n__________________________________________\n\n[Intro]\n(Mmm\u2026 oh\u2026)\nCan you feel it?\n\n[Verse 1]\nGreen eyes in the dark, you barely blink\nBut I feel you watching everything\nYou move like shadows in the night\nAnd I still chase your fading light\nYou don\u2019t speak, and yet I\u2019m tied\nTo all the silence in your eyes\nI reach, but never touch the flame\nYou disappear when I say your name\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time (mmm)\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time (ahh...)\nYou don\u2019t have to say a word\nJust stay before the world turns blind\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time\nBefore your green eyes leave my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou\u2019re a storm without a sound\nA riddle whispered underground\nI try to read the truth in you\nBut every line just slips right through\nGreen eyes, are you cruel or kind?\nAre you a ghost or just the sky?\nYou never run, you never stay\nYou look at me, then drift away\n\n[Chorus 2]\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time (mmm, oh)\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time\nThere\u2019s a voice that calls your name\nBut you vanish every time\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time\nBefore your green eyes blur the line\n\n[Verse 3]\nI want to know the soul you hide\nThe winds that pull behind your eyes\nAre you afraid of what you see\nIn someone standing still like me?\nYou\u2019re the start I never reach\nA poem written out of speech\nGreen eyes cut me like a blade\nBut still, I beg for you to stay\n\n[Chorus 3]\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time (ahh...)\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time\nDon\u2019t let silence be your answer\nDon\u2019t let distance draw the line\nTake my hand, while there\u2019s still time\nLet your green eyes fall on mine\n\n[Bridge]\n(ahhh\u2026 mmm\u2026)\nIf you leave, I\u2019ll still remember\nNot the words, but how you felt\nGreen eyes never told me stories\nBut I heard them just as well\n[End]\n", "type": "edit_v3_export", "duration": 231.85066666666665, "has_vocal": false, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "video_upload_width": 688, "video_upload_height": 1024, "can_remix": false, "is_remix": false}, "caption": "\ud83e\udef6Choose love over hate, always\ud83e\udef6| #SUNO'S_SPIRIT", "is_liked": false, "user_id": "1fda17d9-6afd-4c2a-9d70-c6ef111212f0", "display_name": "\ud83d\uded1Lucilius\ud83d\uded1", "handle": "lucilius", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/85889792.webp", "is_trashed": false, "is_public": true, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 67, "flag_count": 1, "display_tags": "deep house, electronic, ambient", "is_contest_clip": false, "created_at": "2025-06-27T13:36:26.765Z", "status": "complete", "title": "\ud83c\udf75Green Eyes\ud83c\udf75[@matchachocolate69] \ud83d\udc8c #JuneOfLove", "play_count": 1129, "upvote_count": 314, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "af815b30-bc38-4a61-b0bf-333a2d625c8e", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/af815b30-bc38-4a61-b0bf-333a2d625c8e.mp4", "video_cover_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_44ab222a-f36e-4f8a-be8f-2777e09af32a.mp4", "preview_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_44ab222a-f36e-4f8a-be8f-2777e09af32a_preview.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/af815b30-bc38-4a61-b0bf-333a2d625c8e.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/af815b30-bc38-4a61-b0bf-333a2d625c8e_e6cd1494.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/af815b30-bc38-4a61-b0bf-333a2d625c8e_e6cd1494.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-auk", "metadata": {"tags": "A wild fusion at 200bpm: punchy drum & bass/jungle groove with massive hard snares, gritty Britpop guitars and rapid-fire UK punk energy.

say, matching the mood\nOr you act frightened, wondering, \u201cWill I be okay?\u201d\nWhen I say, \u201cI\u2019ll protect you,\u201d\nDoes that sound like a flag being raised?\n\nBecause the midday moon is watching,\nFor now, I\u2019ll hold myself back for you\nA wolf mingling among everyone,\nFangs hidden behind a coffee cup\n\nI like people who are strong and tough\nJust as much as soft, pale ones\nGently holding your hand in mine,\nIf I look up and smile sweetly, it\u2019s so easy\n\nPretending to be scared, \u201cIt\u2019s so dark,\u201d\nPretending to flatter, \u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d\nLuring you down a deserted path,\nIf I\u2019ve raised a flag, I have to use it, right?\n\nBecause the midnight moon is watching,\nThere\u2019s nothing to fear, right? It\u2019s okay\nI\u2019m a wolf blending in among everyone\nAren\u2019t my pearl-white fangs lovely?\n\nEach night, one person is killed by the wolf\nAt noon, one human is killed\nPeople keep disappearing, one by one,\nJust as the wolves once vanished\n\nIf a human is left at the end,\nOr if a wolf is standing at the end,\nWhich one is the winner?\nWhich one is the loser?\n\nWithin me are mixed\nHuman genes and wolf blood\nThe moon quietly watches\nAs I can\u2019t resist my instincts\n\nThe round moon is watching\nAs I\u2019m bathed in the red of life\nThank you for the delicious meal\nI raise both hands toward the sky\n\nWhen the moon disappears, the game is over\nA wolf with a full belly,\nAnd the stripped human bones\nMaybe I\u2019ll use them for soup stock\n\nUntil I get hungry again,\nOr until someone hunts me down\n", "edited_clip_id": "91c566bf-0005-4cb4-ac90-cf5ef25440a7", "type": "edit_crop", "duration": 220.88, "can_publish_with_vocal": true,
