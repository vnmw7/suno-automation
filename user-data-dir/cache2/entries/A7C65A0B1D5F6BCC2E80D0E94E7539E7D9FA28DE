Instrumentation gradually reduces, often leaving only piano or acoustic guitar with subtle pads. Characteristic guitar chords (e.g., Gbadd9/add#11 and Gbadd9, alternating with B7sus2 and Bm7 ) are prominently used here, providing a distinct bittersweet harmonic color at the very end. Harmony resolves to F Major or D Minor, giving a bittersweet sense of closure, leaving the listener with a lingering feeling of nostalgia and acceptance.

I\u2019ll find.\nDon\u2019t you cry, though wounded deep,\nYour tears will glow, their promise keep.\n\nBreak the night\u2014ignite your flame!\nTears will light the future\u2019s name.\nI was scared to be alone,\nHeart in hiding, turned to stone.\n\nYet beyond the shadow\u2019s reign,\nI see a light that calls my name.\nIf the world won\u2019t let me in,\nHope will never leave again.\n\nEvery tear, a shining guide,\nLighting paths so far and wide.\nI believe in dawn\u2019s embrace\u2014\nIn morning skies, I\u2019ll find my place.\n\nEvery time my tears arise,\nThey give me strength, they clear my eyes.\nI\u2019ll embrace the darkest sea\u2014\nI live in light that flows through me.\n\nBeyond the tears,\nA light appears.\n\n---\n\n\u76ee\u3092\u9589\u3058\u308c\u3070

salvation.\n\nHer laughter rings out, even as life fades around her. \nIt\u2019s a twisted celebration, she\u2019s both the victim and the harbinger of destruction. \nIn the end, Mia is trapped by

algebraic structure,\nTurns rainfall into quartz-line rapture,\nSidewalks shift at tectonic juncture,\nCities exhale an ultraviolet rupture.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nApplause condenses like propane on the brain,\nThicker than flame \u2014 it laces each vein,\nDelight unspools, a chromatic chain,\nEvery beat breeds a bi-naural migraine.\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the joy, it\u2019s a guillotine!\nSwinging high, it\u2019s obscene.\nYour radiance swells, devours the core,\nHappiness that murders more.\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLow-end filth weaves an imploding quilt,\nYour beam tilts worlds, absolving their guilt.\n\n[Verse 2]\nHoneyed syllables anesthetize,\nLocking synapse sparks they paralyze,\nTouches leave spores that vandalize,\nGold decays to voids that euthanize.\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEvery cheer warps orbit\u2019s core,\nPetals implode, propagating spore,\nMelody spins a torque encore,\nGravity splits on your overture.\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, the joy, it\u2019s a guillotine!\nSwinging high, it\u2019s obscene.\nYour radiance swells, devours the core,\nHappiness that murders more\n\n[Post Chorus]\nI bleed delight through each severed vessel\u2014\n(it\u2019s wrong\u2014)\nI feast on dread as if it soothes the pain\u2014\n(no mercy\u2014)\n\n[Verse 3]\nStrings splinter under plasma bite,\nkisses spark in clandestine rite,\nAir constricts, devouring appetite,\nAafterflash inks glyphs in crimson spite.\n\n[Bridge]\nI drown your fibers with blistered delirium\u2014\nI warp your heartbeat to savage equilibrium\u2014\nI baptize your hope in acidic euphonium\u2014\nI cradle your bliss within crimson sanitarium\u2014\n\n[Breakdown]\nScreams stream back through the memory seam,\nYour joy juices out like rancid cream,\nWe barter breaths in an unholy scheme,\nTrading life to feed another lumen beam.\n\n[Chorus]\nI am the joy\u2014I\u2019m the guillotine!\nSwinging megalith, obscene machine.\nMy radiance swells\u2014I consume your core,\neuphoria hungers for more.\nmore-\n\n[Outro]\nWire-strings liquefy into ichor sprawl, \n(help me)\nStreetlights ulcerate across shattered walls, \n(save me)\nBell-tolls rupture in a carnal brawl, \n(mercy)\nMy joy devours

I ask the wind, the rain, every red light\u2014 but they stay silent, just like me.\n\nI once thought finding the exit meant finding myself, but maybe getting lost is the only way.

The vocal delivery is heartfelt, melancholic, and soaring\u2014especially in the repeated \u201cmaybe\u201d lines, which are drawn out and intensely emotional.

Meeting a True Artist \ud83c\udfad\nSome artists don\u2019t just follow trends\u2014they create their own universe. Maybe is one of them. \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udf3f\n\nI discovered her one night, in my time zone \ud83c\udf19, back when comments didn\u2019t exist on Suno. At that time, she was singing emotional songs, sometimes in French, sometimes in Chinese, with a sensitivity that truly touched the soul \ud83d\udcab.\n\nBut as I followed her more closely, I was heartbroken. Maybe wasn\u2019t receiving any recognition, and her talent seemed invisible to others \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f. When comments finally became possible, I wanted to express my admiration. Yet, that night, I didn\u2019t see a shining Maybe\u2014I saw a Maybe who was crushed, deeply affected \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udca7.\n\n2. An Injustice on Suno \u2696\ufe0f\nWhy this sadness? Why was such a gifted and authentic artist receiving no recognition? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI observed, and I understood. The like system \ud83d\udc4d\u274c, this merciless mechanism that ranks, sorts, and reduces artists to numbers, was the root of her suffering. But Maybe wasn\u2019t alone\u2014an entire community of creators lived the same reality \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc65.\n\nTalented artists, Suno\u2019s \"invisible\" creators, were making music with no one taking the time to listen \ud83d\udd07. This injustice outraged me \ud83d\udd25.\n\n3. The Transformation of a Fearless Artist \ud83e\udd8b\nBut Maybe is a fighter. She could have given up, disappeared, but instead, she chose to turn her pain into creative fuel. \u26a1\ud83c\udfa8\n\nI watched Maybe take musical risks, step outside her comfort zone \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8, and explore new genres like house music \ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udd0a, which she had never tried before. She reinvented herself, regained confidence, and realized that her creativity shouldn\u2019t depend on validation \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude80.\n\nSlowly but surely, she emerged, creating captivating tracks, sometimes rhythmic \ud83e\udd41, sometimes emotional \ud83d\udc9c, sometimes even experimental \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f.\n\n4. Maybe Today: A Beam of Light \ud83c\udf1e\nToday, Maybe is no longer alone \ud83e\udd1d. She has found friends, she smiles, she creates with passion, not to please others but simply to express herself \ud83d\udc95.\n\nHer greatest strength isn\u2019t just her talent\u2014it\u2019s her positive spirit \ud83d\udca1, this energy that radiates warmth and attracts others with the same beautiful mindset \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf08.\n\n5.

{"tags": "The track is an electronic lo-fi pop song in the key of A minor, with a tempo of approximately 120 BPM. The instrumentation includes a four-on-the-floor drum machine pattern with a prominent kick and snare, a pulsing synth bassline providing rhythmic drive, and a sustained synth pad playing a simple A minor to G major to C major to F major chord progression. The female lead vocal is melancholic in tone, processed with a medium decay plate reverb and some subtle delay. The song structure consists of two verses, separated by instrumental breaks and a section with a distorted pad and vocalizations, followed by another verse section. The mix is centered, with the synth elements creating a hazy, lo-fi atmosphere supporting the dry lead vocal.", "prompt": "(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI keep thinking of you begging for my kiss\nI'd drop everything like this\nThere could be a chance of bliss\nYou're that cool boy that's for sure you say let's chill\nEven when you brush my cheek\nGot me feeling so so weak\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so lonely\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n\nI'm so lonely\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n\n[Verse 2]\nPosting fever I bought that bed from IKEA\nSo that you would stay over\nLaugh until we can't no more\nWore new gloss told my girls you might come across\nEven when the night turns cold\nYou're the only hand I'd hold\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so lonely\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n\nI'm so lonely\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)\n(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na)", "edited_clip_id": "5116d44e-6386-4b0f-8264-25f09eae6853", "type": "upsample", "duration": 139.92, "refund_credits": false, "stream": false, "has_vocal": true, "can_publish_with_vocal": true, "is_audio_upload_tos_accepted": true, "upsample_clip_id": "5116d44e-6386-4b0f-8264-25f09eae6853", "video_upload_width": 576, "video_upload_height": 1024, "task": "upsample", "can_remix": true, "is_remix": false, "priority": 10}, "caption": "sampled m3gatron chords", "is_liked": false, "user_id": "d6a774a3-adb3-4cd3-b315-754180ccafd4", "display_name": "Yamill", "handle": "yamill", "is_handle_updated": true, "avatar_image_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/af392a24.webp", "is_trashed": false, "explicit": false, "comment_count": 66, "flag_count": 2, "display_tags": "chill drum n bass + soft rnb vocals", "created_at": "2025-06-04T16:07:42.736Z", "status": "complete", "title": "i'm so lonely", "play_count": 16971, "upvote_count": 610, "is_public": true, "allow_comments": true}, {"id": "f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5", "entity_type": "song_schema", "video_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5.mp4", "video_cover_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_952aed7d-f358-4b4c-b98e-f8487fde5129.mp4", "preview_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/video_upload_952aed7d-f358-4b4c-b98e-f8487fde5129_preview.mp4", "audio_url": "https://cdn1.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5.mp3", "image_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5_4ed98122.jpeg", "image_large_url": "https://cdn2.suno.ai/f11e51b0-b9bb-4767-9fb2-fef875d63ec5_4ed98122.jpeg", "major_model_version": "v4.5", "model_name": "chirp-auk", "metadata": {"tags": "Opens with pounding Frenchcore kicks and aggressive Soviet-style rave synths, then rapid-fire rap verses ride over distorted hits and sharp metallic basses, Deathstep drops crash in, unleashing growling subs, hyper-compressed kicks, and EQ\u2019d, punchy techno bass\u2014all tightly mastered for seismic, professional impact, THX, dolby atmos", "prompt": "//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nThis is our joint work with the castle defender and worthy knight Sir CumAlot.
